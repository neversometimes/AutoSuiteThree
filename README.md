This repository is a set of Selenium tests I wrote against a practice web site.  It's not exhaustive, but hopefully demonstrates some of my skills that can be used in future project opportunities.
This suite includes Extent reporting, retry and screenshots on failure, and a bit of thread safety to better handle the reporting when running tests in parallel.
